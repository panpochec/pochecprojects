										<h1>Schiff bases: data extraction and comfiles building</h1>
									</header>
									<p align="justify">First part of the project consisted of extracting data from logfiles generated by Gaussian - a specialized molecular modeling program. It takes input files (with .com extension) and optimizes energies by manipulating spacial distribution of atoms, and then returns the step-by-step results in a .log file</p>
									<p align="justify">As the research procedure may include multiple steps of modeling (initial structure optimization, wavefunction files generation (wfn), single-point calculations etc.) it is neccessery to extract the results of calculations and feed them back into Gaussian as a new comfile. </p>
									<p align="justify">	Most of the code used in this part of research may be a little chaotic, and some tricks were used to achieve results - this is mostly due to the very tight schedule. But, even though it's ugly, it got the job done remarkably well! </p>

											<p>Gaussian logfile structure<br> 
											
												<p align="justify">The main downside of Gaussian logfiles is that the data are provided as a text file, with only quasi-structure. This results in significant issues while trying to acquire meaningful elements from the raw text. One needs to either use specialized programs (such as Molden, Avogadro and others) or extract and clean data by hand.</p>
												<p align="justify">Using third-party software has its downsides -  most use proprietary codes and solutions. This means that automation of the process is very difficult. It also leaves less space for customizing the outcome.</p>
												<p align="justify">This is why I have used Python for a batch extraction and new comfiles preparation. It is relatively fast, but requires good knowledge of logfile structure, keywords used for different built-in Gaussian mechanisms, as well as general knowledge of molecular modeling process.</p>

										<p>This part of the project was divided into two sections.</p>
										<p align="justify">First section consisted of reading the optimized logfiles for 546 structures of compounds. There were 91 compunds for each type (we have called them meta, ortho and para due to the relation on the middle ring) and each was optimized in gas phase and using PCM (Polarizable Continuum Model). The optimized structures were then used to generate input files for the methods: single-point wfn + population analysis and two scan inputfiles - one for each hydrogen bridge. This resulted in generation of 1636 comfiles. The most difficult were the scan files, as they required not only matrix acquisition, but automatic assigning bridge atoms as "modredundant" parameters, one set for each bridge.</p>

											<p>The simplest form of a comfile - optimalization and frequencies calculation.<br>
											The header (highlighted) includes information about functional and basis set used for calculation, followed by the name for the generated logfile, charge and multiplicity. <br>
											Last part is the atom matrix, where the atom type and its xyz coordinates are stored.</p>

										<p align="justify">The second (and arguably harder) section was reading the logfiles from scans, assigning and acquiring specific datasets and producing a csv table containing data for all of the analyzed files. </p>
										<p align="justify">This was very tricky, as one of the parts was assigning (using indirect "clues", such as joint distance, angle or dihedral angle) numeration to the specific atoms and then using these labels to acquire additional information about the given atoms. <br>
											For example, the difficulty in assigning nitrogens to the specific category was due to them having three roles: bridge atom, amino substituent or nitro substituent. This was solved by knowing that nitrogen in amino group will have an angle were only nitrogen and hydrogen atoms are present. Similarly, nitro group will only have nitrogen and oxygens. </p>
										<p align="justify">Additionaly, the plots of energy profiles for scans were generated. All of the resulting data was then used in the Part 2 of the project.</p>
